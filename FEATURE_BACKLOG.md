## Prioritization framework (simple scoring)
Score each feature from 1–5 on:
- **Impact** (retention / wellbeing / activation)
- **Effort** (lower effort = higher score)
- **Differentiation** (how unique vs existing diary apps)
- **Revenue potential**

**Priority Score = Impact + Effort + Differentiation + Revenue**

Use the score to select next sprint items objectively.
